- 👋 Hi, I’m @Connao0531

- The program works with the data inside the JSON file, it was coded in a way that, no matter how much dicts you enter in the file, it will work just fine.
- In order for the program to work, first, you must run the jsonregen.py. Then, run the main .py.
- You can alter the json by modifying the code in the jsonregen.py, you can add a new dict by creating a new pokemon instance.
- There is currently two pokemon instances as example for the program, but you can add as much as you like.
- Keep in mind status moves wont work, I haven't coded that yet.
  

- Special thanks to Nov for helping me optimize the code. (His discord is: __nov
